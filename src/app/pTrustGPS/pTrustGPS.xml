        <synopsis>
          This process publishes a single variable that says if we should trust GPS measurements or not.
            If either:
            - we send a command for the AUV to dive below a given thresold, at which we are sure the GPS sensor is submerged
            - we measure a depth at which we are sure the GPS sensor is submerged
            - the QUALITY signal of the GPS is false
            we should not use the GPS.
            When the AUV dives for some time and surface to get a GPS fix, the Kalman filter inside the GPS sensor might not converge instantly, therefore we should wait a bit before trusting its position.
            Therefore, we check the latest PARANOIA_LEVEL number of GPS measurements. If ALL of them were considered trustable, we trust the current GPS measurements. That means that if a single GPS measurement was not considered reliable in this buffer, we don't believe the GPS for the moment.
