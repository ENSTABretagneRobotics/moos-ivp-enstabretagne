3°) Arduino

Juste upload __Distance_as_Fast_as_Possible.ino__ in a classic arduino board.
For cabling see https://github.com/PulsedLight3D/LIDARLite_Basics/blob/master/Arduino/LIDARLite_I2C_Library_GetDistance_ContinuousRead/README.md .

You need a library :The 'Arduino I2C Master Library' from DSS Circuits: http://www.dsscircuits.com/index.php/articles/66-arduino-i2c-master-library



Il y a juste a téléverser __Distance_as_Fast_as_Possible.ino__ dans une arduino
si problème cablage voir https://github.com/PulsedLight3D/LIDARLite_Basics/blob/master/Arduino/LIDARLite_I2C_Library_GetDistance_ContinuousRead/README.md

Il faut installer cette librairie dans arduino 

The 'Arduino I2C Master Library' from DSS Circuits: http://www.dsscircuits.com/index.php/articles/66-arduino-i2c-master-library

Valable si  lidarliteV2 sinon prendre les autres sketch.
