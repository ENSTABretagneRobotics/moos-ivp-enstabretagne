NMEA library

Disclaimer

The National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) has developed a specification
that defines the interface between various pieces of marine electronic
equipment. The standard permits marine electronics to send information to
computers and to other marine equipment.

Most computer programs that provide real time position information understand
and expect data to be in NMEA format. This data includes the complete PVT
(position, velocity, time) solution computed by the GPS receiver. The idea of
NMEA is to send a line of data called a sentence that is totally self contained
and independent from other sentences. All NMEA sentences are sequences of ACSII
symbols that begin with a '$' and end with a carriage return/line feed sequence
and can be no longer than 80 characters of visible text (plus the line
terminators).
